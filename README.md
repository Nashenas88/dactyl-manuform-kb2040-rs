# Dactyl Manuform firmware for Adafruit kb2040 in Rust

`elf2uf2-rs` is configured as the default runner, since the kb2040 does not expose any debugging
pins on the rp2040.

With the kb2040 in boot mode (hold BOOT button, press RESET button, then release BOOT button)
```sh
cargo run --release
```

- The standard Rust tooling (cargo, rustup) which you can install from https://rustup.rs/

- Toolchain support for the cortex-m0+ processors in the rp2040 (thumbv6m-none-eabi)

<!-- ALTERNATIVE RUNNERS -->

If you don't have a debug probe or if you want to do interactive debugging you can set up an alternative runner for cargo.  

Some of the options for your `runner` are listed below:

* **Loading a UF2 over USB**  
  *Step 1* - Install [`elf2uf2-rs`](https://github.com/JoNil/elf2uf2-rs):

  ```console
  $ cargo install elf2uf2-rs --locked
  ```

  *Step 2* - Make sure your .cargo/config contains the following

  ```toml
  [target.thumbv6m-none-eabi]
  runner = "elf2uf2-rs -d"
  ```

  The `thumbv6m-none-eabi` target may be replaced by the all-Arm wildcard
  `'cfg(all(target_arch = "arm", target_os = "none"))'`.

  *Step 3* - Boot your RP2040 into "USB Bootloader mode", typically by rebooting
  whilst holding some kind of "Boot Select" button. On Linux, you will also need
  to 'mount' the device, like you would a USB Thumb Drive.

  *Step 4* - Use `cargo run`, which will compile the code and started the
  specified 'runner'. As the 'runner' is the elf2uf2-rs tool, it will build a UF2
  file and copy it to your RP2040.
